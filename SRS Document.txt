SRS Document

1. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the image classification web application.
The web application will allow users to upload an image file, which will be classified using a machine learning model.
The web application will be built using Spring Boot, Python, TensorFlow, Flask, and Thymeleaf.


2. Functional Requirements
FR1: Image Upload
The web application shall allow users to upload an image file from their computer.

FR2: Image Classification
The web application shall use a convolutional neural network machine learning model to classify the uploaded image.

FR2.1: Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model shall be trained using a publicly available dataset with a minimum accuracy of 95%.
The model shall be saved in a format compatible with TensorFlow.

FR2.2: Classification Results
The web application shall display the top three classification results to the user, including the predicted class label and the associated confidence score.

FR3: User Interface
The web application shall provide a user-friendly interface that is easy to use.

FR3.1: Home Page
The home page shall allow users to upload an image file and display the classification results.

FR3.2: About Page
The about page shall provide information about the web application, the machine learning model, and the development team.

FR3.3: Error Page
The error page shall be displayed if there is an issue with the image upload or classification.


3. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR1: Performance
The web application shall be responsive and fast, with a maximum response time of 3 seconds.

NFR2: Availability
The web application shall be available 99% of the time, with a maximum downtime of 1 hour per month.

NFR3: Security
The web application shall be secure, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data. User data shall be encrypted in transit and at rest.

NFR4: Scalability
The web application shall be scalable, so it can handle up to 1,000 concurrent users and up to 100 image uploads per minute.

NFR5: Maintainability
The web application shall be maintainable and extensible, with code that is well-documented and follows best practices.


4. Technical Requirements
TR1: Backend Framework
The web application shall be built using Spring Boot as the backend framework.

TR2: Machine Learning Model
The web application shall use a convolutional neural network machine learning model, implemented in Python and TensorFlow.

TR3: Python Application
The Python application shall be implemented using Flask and provide a RESTful API for image classification.

TR4: User Interface
The user interface shall be implemented using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.

TR5: HTTP Requests
The web application shall use RestTemplate to make HTTP requests to the Python application.


5. Assumptions and Dependencies
AD1: Machine Learning Model
The web application assumes that the machine learning model has been trained and tested on a suitable dataset with a minimum accuracy of 95%.

AD2: Web and Database Servers
The web application depends on the availability of a reliable web server and database server.

AD3: Machine Learning Environment
The web application depends on the availability of a suitable machine learning environment with Python and TensorFlow.


6. Constraints
The web application must comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to data privacy and security.
This includes compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other applicable data privacy laws.
The development team must ensure that all user data is securely stored and processed,
and that appropriate measures are taken to protect against unauthorized access or data breaches.
